# Manjuu Stub API

This is a quick stub to develop locally or build tests against.

This uses live like data for a select few authorities from the food hygiene service,
but pagination has not been implemented.

## Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
